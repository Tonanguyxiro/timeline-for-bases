# AGENT.md

This file is for future coding agents working on `timeline-for-bases`.

It is intentionally repo-scoped. Do not add personal machine details, usernames, home directories, vault names, tokens, or other environment-specific configuration here. If you need local paths or vault information, discover them from the current workspace instead of assuming they match a previous machine.

## Purpose

`timeline-for-bases` adds a timeline view to Obsidian Bases with day/week/month/quarter/year scales, editable task bars, grouped views, and inline property editing.

Agents should prefer small, verified changes over broad rewrites. This plugin has a lot of UI behavior that only becomes clear in a live Obsidian session.

## Local Development Conventions

Important:

- Do not hardcode machine-specific paths, vault names, or deployment targets in repo docs or source.
- Discover local verification vaults and plugin install targets from the active workspace.
- After deploying a new build into a live Obsidian environment, reload the app or vault before verifying behavior.

## Build And Test

Primary commands:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

Helpful combined flow:

```bash
npm run build
```

Watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev:watch
```

Notes:

- `npm test` runs the lightweight helper test suite from `scripts/test.mjs`.
- `npm run build` runs TypeScript checks and the production bundle.
- Use the repo's local deployment script when the current workspace has one configured.
- `scripts/watch.mjs` builds on change and tries to deploy after successful rebuilds.

## Release Workflow

This repo uses Git tags and GitHub Actions for releases.

Standard release flow:

1. Make sure the worktree is in the intended state.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Bump the version with one of:
   - `npm version patch`
   - `npm version minor`
   - `npm version major`
4. Push the release commit:
   - `git push origin main`
5. Push the version tag:
   - `git push origin --tags`

Release notes:

- Tags must match Obsidian's required plain `x.y.z` format.
- Do not use a `v` prefix.
- `npm version ...` updates `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and creates the tag.
- The repo `version` script also updates `manifest.json` and `versions.json`.
- GitHub Actions should publish release assets:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `main.js`
  - `styles.css`
- The release workflow lives in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Architecture Notes

Recent refactors intentionally moved tricky logic into focused helper modules:

- `src/timeline-date.ts`
  Strict day-based parsing and calendar-safe date math.
- `src/timeline-drag.ts`
  Drag and resize range resolution.
- `src/timeline-persistence.ts`
  Scoped per-base/per-view persistence helpers.

Keep new logic near these boundaries instead of adding more complexity back into `src/timeline-view.ts`.

## Behavior Invariants

These are easy to regress and should be preserved unless intentionally redesigned:

- Timeline date semantics are day-based.
  Ignore time-of-day values for rendering and editing.
- Editing a filename-backed primary column should rename the note, not write fake frontmatter.
- The first ordered Bases property is the primary frozen column.
- Group collapse state should persist per base view.
- Time scale should persist per base view.
- Right-click on a bar must not enter drag mode.
- Grouped collapsed views should not leak timeline/grid artifacts between group headers.
- Deployment should be treated as copy-based unless the current workspace explicitly uses a different strategy.

## Bases View Persistence — Critical Pitfalls

Bases' `requestSave()` destroys and recreates the custom view instance. This has cascading consequences:

- **Custom keys get stripped.** Only keys declared in `getViewOptions()` survive Bases' save pipeline. All other keys (colorMap, propColWidths, timeScale, etc.) are silently removed.
- **Per-instance state is lost.** `_viewConfigOverrides` and any in-memory render counters are cleared on recreation.
- **Solution: `persistOnly=true` pattern.** Skip `config.set()` (which triggers auto-save) and `requestSave()`. Instead write custom keys directly to the `.base` file via `vault.modify()` using `_persistCustomKeysDirect`. This avoids the white-flash recreation cascade.
- **Reading undeclared keys after recreation** requires a fallback chain: `_viewConfigOverrides` → raw YAML from `getViewData()` via regex → `config.getAsPropertyId()`.

### Custom keys wiped when a native option changes

`_collectCustomOverrides()` only returns keys present in `_viewConfigOverrides` (this session's edits). On a freshly opened view that map is empty. So when a native option (sort, order) triggers `requestSave()` — which strips ALL undeclared keys from the file — `_persistCustomKeys` had nothing to restore, silently wiping colorBy/colorMap/borderBy saved in a previous session. This is why settings "didn't save" and different tabs/pages rendered differently. **Fix: `hydrateOverridesFromFile()` runs once per view (start of `render()`), seeding `_viewConfigOverrides` from the persisted `.base` via `extractCustomKeysFromYaml` so the override set is always complete.** Session edits take precedence over the file. Direct writes are serialized through `_persistQueue` so rapid swatch clicks can't snapshot stale file content and clobber each other.

### encodeMap/decodeMap key format mismatch

`encodeMap` strips JSON quotes from keys for clean YAML (e.g. `"note.priority"` → `note.priority`), but `loadConfig` looked up widths using `JSON.stringify(prop)` which produces `'"note.priority"'`. The lookup always missed, falling back to defaults — causing snap-back on resize. **Always check both JSON-stringified and plain string forms of keys when looking up decoded map values.**

### Infinite render loops from key mismatch

`decodeMap` must NOT re-quote keys containing dots. When `colorBy` was set to `file.fullname`, values like `Agree on travel dates.md` got re-quoted, breaking the key match in `ensureColorMap` → always returned `changed=true` → `vault.modify()` → Bases `onDataUpdated` → render → infinite loop at ~40 renders/sec. This also caused the colorBy dropdown to close instantly (the entire view was being destroyed and recreated on each render).

### BasesPropertyId as object vs string

The colorBy dropdown stores BasesPropertyId via `JSON.parse(propSelect.value)`. For string properties like `"file.fullname"`, this produces a plain string. But `getPropertyIdFromConfig` must handle both cases — if `_viewConfigOverrides[key]` is an object, `String(override)` produces `"[object Object]"`. Check `typeof === 'string'` first; for objects, use `toString()` and return `null` if it yields `[object Object]`.

**Write path must coerce too (not just the read path).** `formatValueLine` in `timeline-base-yaml.ts` only serializes string/number/boolean — an object value returns `null`, so the `colorBy`/`borderBy` line is silently left unchanged in the `.base` file. Because the re-quoting pass for other keys still flips `changed=true`, the file *does* get written (e.g. colorMap re-quoted) while the new colorBy value is dropped — the exact symptom of "changing the colorBy dropdown doesn't save." **Fix: coerce the parsed dropdown value to a canonical string id via `toPropertyIdString` before `setViewConfigValue`, and defensively re-coerce `CUSTOM_PROPERTY_KEYS` in `_collectCustomOverrides`.** Tests for the underlying hazard live in `tests/timeline-base-yaml.test.ts`.

### Plugin must be in community-plugins.json

Plugins using `registerBasesView()` will NOT auto-load after a full Obsidian reload unless their plugin ID is listed in `.obsidian/community-plugins.json`. After reload the view shows "Unknown view type: timeline" because Obsidian never loaded the plugin. When deploying manually, always verify the ID is in that file.

### UI list caps

When a control could produce unbounded entries (e.g., color pickers for a property with 100 unique values), cap at a reasonable limit (10) with a warning message. Keep the data model complete (all values in colorMap) — only the rendered pickers are capped.

## Verification Expectations

For UI changes:

1. Build the plugin.
2. Deploy the build into the active local test environment when available.
3. Reload the live Obsidian app or vault.
4. Verify behavior in a live Obsidian vault when available.
5. Check for runtime errors after the interaction you changed.

Prefer verifying:

- scale persistence
- grouped collapse/expand persistence
- drag and resize behavior in day view
- click-to-edit behavior for cells
- right-click context menu behavior
- grouped rendering after collapse

## Documentation Guidance

Keep user-facing README content focused on installation, what the plugin does, and user-visible features.

Put agent-oriented workflow notes here instead of expanding the README with contributor-only operational details.
